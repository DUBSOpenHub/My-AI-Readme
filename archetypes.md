# 🎭 My AI README Archetypes

Your archetype is auto-assigned based on your answers during profile creation. It appears on your profile card and helps teammates understand your working style at a glance.

| Archetype | Emoji | Superpower Match | Communication Match |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| The Architect | 🏗️ | Making complex things simple | Slack-first, Async |
| The Connector | 🤝 | Bringing people together | Face-to-face |
| The Shipper | 🚀 | Shipping fast and iterating | Slack-first |
| The Sage | 🔬 | Deep expertise in my domain | Email, Async |
| The Questioner | ❓ | Asking the right questions | Whatever works |
| The Organizer | 📋 | Keeping everyone organized | Async |
| The Night Owl | 🦉 | *(any)* | *(peaks after lunch)* |
| The Spark | 💡 | *(any)* | Face-to-face |

## How Assignment Works

1. **Primary match** — your superpower answer maps to an archetype
2. **Tiebreaker** — if multiple archetypes match, communication style breaks the tie
3. **Night Owl override** — if productivity window is "Night owl", you get 🦉 regardless
4. **Manual override** — you can always change your archetype in your profile frontmatter

## Archetype Compatibility

Some archetypes pair especially well:

- **Architect × Questioner** — one simplifies, the other pressure-tests. Great design reviews.
- **Connector × Sage** — one brings people together, the other brings deep knowledge. Perfect for cross-team projects.
- **Shipper × Organizer** — one moves fast, the other keeps things on track. Ship without chaos.
- **Spark × Night Owl** — creative energy meets deep focus. Best brainstorm partners.

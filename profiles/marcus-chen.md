## 💬 How to Work With Me

**Communication:** I'm an async-first person. Slack me, and I'll respond thoughtfully — usually within an hour. For anything that needs real-time discussion, throw a 25-minute meeting on my calendar (not 30 — I need buffer). I write long messages and I'm not sorry about it. 😄

**Best Hours:** I'm a night owl who's learned to function in a morning world. My deep focus window is 2pm–6pm — that's when I write my best code. Mornings are for code review, Slack, and pretending to be alert.

**Feedback:** Give it to me in writing first — a GitHub comment, a Slack DM, even a doc. I need time to process before I respond. If we discuss it live, I'll probably say "let me think about that" and come back stronger. Don't mistake that for disagreement — it's just how I work.

## ⚡ My Superpower
Asking the right questions. Before I write a line of code, I'll ask 5 questions that reshape the problem. My PRs are small, my designs are thorough, and I catch edge cases before they catch us. I'm the person who says "what about…?" in the design review, and two weeks later we're all glad I did.

## 🔋 What Drains Me
Context switching. If I'm deep in a problem and get pulled into an unrelated meeting, it takes me 30+ minutes to get back in the zone. If you need me urgently, Slack me first so I can wrap up my thought. Also: long email threads. Just… no.

## 💬 How to Work With Me

**Communication:** Face-to-face (or camera-on video) is my love language. I read body language and energy — it helps me understand what people *really* think, not just what they type. For quick stuff, Slack is great. For feedback on designs, let's look at it together.

**Best Hours:** I'm steady throughout the day, but I protect 9am–11am for creative work. If my Slack status says 🎧, I'm in the zone — I'll respond when I surface. Afternoons are great for collaboration and critiques.

**Feedback:** Wrap it in context. Tell me *why* something doesn't work, not just that it doesn't. "This button feels off" → 😕. "This button competes with the primary CTA and users might miss the checkout flow" → 💡. I genuinely love feedback that makes my work better.

## ⚡ My Superpower
Bringing people together. I'm the one who pulls engineering, product, and design into a room (or a Figma file) and gets everyone aligned. I translate between disciplines — I can explain a technical constraint to a PM and a business goal to an engineer. My favorite moments are when someone says "oh, I didn't realize that's what you meant!"

## 🔋 What Drains Me
Unnecessary meetings where nothing gets decided. If there's no agenda and no outcome, it could have been a Slack thread. Also, redesigning something for the 4th time because we didn't align on requirements upfront. Let's get clear first, *then* design.

## 🎲 Fun Facts
- **Spirit emoji:** 🎨
- **Fun fact:** I've visited 23 countries and I have a travel sketchbook for each one
- **Fuel:** Iced matcha latte + a curated Spotify playlist (genre depends on the mood of the sprint)

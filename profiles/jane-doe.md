## 💬 How to Work With Me

**Communication:** I'm Slack-first — ping me anytime. For anything complex, let's hop on a quick call rather than a 20-message thread. I'm usually fastest to respond between 10am–2pm.

**Best Hours:** I'm an early bird. My brain is sharpest before noon, so that's when I tackle strategy work and deep thinking. Afternoons are for meetings and collaboration — I actually *like* a packed afternoon calendar.

**Feedback:** I love direct feedback — don't sugarcoat it. If something's off, just tell me. I process it best in writing first, then we can discuss live. The worst thing you can do is hold back — I'd rather know now than find out later.

## ⚡ My Superpower
I make complex things simple. Give me a tangled problem — competing priorities, unclear requirements, a 47-slide deck that says nothing — and I'll find the one-sentence version that unlocks the path forward. My teammates say I have a gift for asking the question nobody realized needed asking.

## 🔋 What Drains Me
Ambiguity without a path forward. I can handle uncertainty — that's half of product management — but I need us to at least agree on what the *next step* is. If we leave a meeting without a clear "who's doing what by when," I'll be the one who asks.

## 🎲 Fun Facts
- **Spirit emoji:** 🧩
- **Fun fact:** I once gave a keynote in a language I don't speak (long story involving a mistranslated conference invitation)
- **Fuel:** Oat milk latte, no exceptions. Don't talk to me before the first one.

## 💬 How to Work With Me

**Communication:** Slack is my go-to — ping me anytime and I'll get back to you quickly. For bigger topics that need more nuance, I'd rather jump on a quick huddle than go back and forth in a thread. But for quick questions or updates, Slack is always the fastest way to reach me.

**Best Hours:** I'm an early bird — mornings are when I do my best thinking. If you need me for strategy work or something that requires focus, aim for before noon. Afternoons are great for meetings, collaboration, and catching up on threads.

**Feedback:** I prefer feedback in writing first so I can sit with it and process. Drop me a message or a doc — I'll read it carefully and come back with thoughtful follow-up questions. This isn't me being distant; it's how I give feedback the attention it deserves.

## ⚡ My Superpower
I make complex things simple. Whether it's a tangled cross-team initiative, a gnarly policy question, or a process that's grown ten layers of bureaucracy — I find the core of the problem and distill it into something the whole room can rally around. My favorite moment is when someone says, "Oh, that's it? Why didn't we just say that from the start?"

## 🔋 What Drains Me
Context switching all day wears me down. When I'm bouncing between five different workstreams every hour, none of them get my best thinking. I do my best work when I can batch similar work together and protect blocks of focus time. If you see me blocking calendar time, that's why — and I promise I'll be way more useful to you after.

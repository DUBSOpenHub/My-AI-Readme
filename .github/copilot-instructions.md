# MeetMe — Copilot Instructions

This repository is **MeetMe**, a team profile directory powered by GitHub Copilot CLI.

## What This Repo Contains

- `agents/meetme.agent.md` — The MeetMe agent that guides users through building their "How to Work With Me" profile
- `skills/meetme/meetme.md` — Supporting skill with question bank and profile generation templates
- `profiles/` — Directory of generated team member profiles (Markdown files)
- `templates/profile-template.md` — The Markdown template used to generate profiles

## Key Context

- Each profile is a Markdown file in `profiles/` named `firstname-lastname.md`
- The `profiles/README.md` is an auto-generated directory index listing all profiles
- Profiles are generated by the MeetMe agent, not hand-written
- The agent uses `ask_user` for all interactive questions and `create`/`edit` for file operations
- Users should never need to manually edit profile files — the agent handles everything

## Tone

MeetMe is fun, welcoming, and inclusive. Keep the energy positive. Use emojis. Celebrate small wins. Never make users feel bad for not knowing something.
